# Discord Lambda Py
A template for Discord bot creation using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. This project attempts to offer similar functionality as the [`slash-create`](https://github.com/Snazzah/slash-create) JavaScript library but in a serverless, Python environment.

An example project leveraging this template can be found [here](https://github.com/UF-ACE/stock-prediction).

## Setup
### Discord
1. Activate developer mode on your Discord account.
2. Create a new application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
3. Copy your Application ID and Public Key and save them for later.
3. Navigate to the "Bot" tab and select "Reset Token".
4. Copy your bot's token and save it for later.
5. Navigate to the "Oauth2" tab and select "URL Generator".
6. Select the `applications.commands` scope and paste the generated URL into your browser.
7. Add your bot to your desired server.

### AWS
1. Follow [this tutorial](https://oozio.medium.com/serverless-discord-bot-55f95f26f743) to setup the Lambda environment, but do not add any code to the default Lambda function. This will be done automatically by the template.
    * Set your API Gateway endpoint type to edge-optimized to avoid timeout errors.
    * Make note of your API endpoint.
2. Follow [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@shamnad.p.s/how-to-create-an-s3-bucket-and-aws-access-key-id-and-secret-access-key-for-accessing-it-5653b6e54337) to setup an S3 bucket and keys for accessing it. Be sure to:
    * Give the IAM user full access to S3.
    * Copy the Access Key ID and secret access key and save them for later.
    * Copy the S3 bucket's name and URI (s3://<bucket-name>) and save it for later.

### GitHub
1. Create a new repository using this template.
2. Add the following to your repository's secrets (under "Settings" -> "Secrets").
    * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS Access Key ID.
    * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS Secret Access Key.
    * `APP_ID`: The ID of your Discord application.
    * `PUBLIC_KEY`: The public key of your Discord application.
    * `BOT_TOKEN`: The token of your Discord bot.
2. Clone your new repository.
3. Fill out necessary fields in `.github/workflows/awsLambda.yml`. These fields are marked with `TODO` comments.
    * See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) for a list of region codes.
4. Push your changes to GitHub. This will trigger the workflow, which will deploy your Lambda function if everything is setup correctly.

Once your function is deployed, navigate back to the Discord Developer Portal and paste your API endpoint into the "Interactions Endpoint URL" field on your application's homepage. You should now be able to issue commands in the server you added the bot to.

## Development
### Adding Commands
1. Create a new file in the `commands` directory.
2. Create command functions in the file with the following signature:
    ```python
    def command_name(interaction: Interaction) -> None:
        ...
    ```
    * `interaction` is an `Interaction` object containing information about the command's context. See Class Reference below for more information.
    * Further arguments can be added to the function signature to allow the command to receive options.
3. Create a function in the file with the following signature:
    ```python
    def setup(registry: CommandRegistry) -> None:
        ...
    ```
4. Use the `registry` object to register your command functions. See Class Reference below for more information.

### Using Python Packages
Any additional packages leveraged by your commands should be added to `requirements.txt`. The deployment workflow will automatically upload these packages as a layer to your Lambda function.

### Using Environment Variables
If your custom commands require environment variables, follow these steps:

1. Add your environment variables as GitHub secrets on your repository.
2. Add those variables below [this line](https://github.com/jaARke/discord-lambda-py/blob/6712bd3a5e4b2fb69380898bc6b3f756205f4e08/.github/workflows/awsLambda.yml#L90) in `.github/workflows/awsLambda.yml`.
3. Access your environment variables in your commands using `os.environ.get("ENV_VAR_NAME")`.

This will ensure that your variables are forwarded to the Lambda function when it is deployed.

### Syncing to this Template
This template provides a workflow, `.github/workflows/syncToTemplate.yml`, that can be used to sync your repository with this template. By default, this workflow runs at 5:17am every Friday. To change this, edit [this line](https://github.com/jaARke/discord-lambda-py/blob/6712bd3a5e4b2fb69380898bc6b3f756205f4e08/.github/workflows/syncToTemplate.yml#L6). Alternatively, you can manually trigger the workflow by going to "Actions" -> "Sync to Template" -> "Run workflow".

This workflow will automatically merge any template changes without overwriting any custom commands. It will then open a pull request with the changes. Afterwards, you can review the changes and merge them into your repository.

## Usage
1. Go to the "OAuth2" tab in your Discord application's settings.
2. Under "OAuth2 URL Generator", select the "applications.commands" scope.
3. Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser. This will prompt you to add the bot to a server.
4. Select the server you wish to add the bot to and click "Authorize".
5. Navigate to the server and type `/` in the message box. You should see a list of commands registered to your application.

## Class Reference
### CommandRegistry

The `CommandRegistry` class is responsible for managing commands within an application. It provides functionality to register, update, and find commands. This documentation will cover the class attributes and member functions, along with their respective parameters.

A single `CommandRegistry` object is created when the Lambda function is deployed. During initialization, this object syncs your commands with Discord. It is then serialized and stored in a Lambda layer to be used by the deployed function. This allows the function to access the `CommandRegistry` object without having to reinitialize it on every invocation.

#### Class Attributes

- `commands`: A dictionary storing the registered commands.

#### Constructor

```python
__init__(self, command_dir: str, app_id: str, bot_token: str) -> None
```

The constructor initializes an instance of the `CommandRegistry` class.

- `command_dir`: A string representing the directory where command files are located.
- `app_id`: A string representing the ID of the application associated with the commands.
- `bot_token`: A string representing the token for the bot account.

#### Member Functions

```python
__register_commands(self, command_dir: str) -> None
```

```

This method registers a command group.

- `name`: A string representing the name of the command group.
- `desc`: A string representing the description of the command group. Default is `None`.

defer(self) -> None
```

This method defers the interaction so that a response can be sent later. After an interaction is deferred, a response will need to be sent within 15 minutes to avoid timeout.
